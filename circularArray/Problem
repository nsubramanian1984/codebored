Problem

Implement a circular array of size N, and query the elements at specific positions after K rotations.

Input;
3 2 3
1 2 3
0
1
2

First line contains values for size N, rotations K and number of positional queries after K rotations.
Second line contains elements of the array
Subsequent lines contains values for position queries. In above case, there are 3 rotations and three values separated by line-feed character.

Output:
2
3
1

Explanation:
Before rotation   : [ 1, 2, 3 ]
After rotation #1 : [ 3, 1, 2 ]
After rotation #2 : [ 2, 3, 1 ]
